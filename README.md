# Nim

Nim is a strategy game where players take turns removing a non-negative number of objects from a a distinct pile. The goal of the game is to avoid taking the last object. Using reinforcement learning, this program trains an AI agent to play the game of Nim. Q-learning is used to learn a reward value for an action. An action that loses the game will have a reward of -1, an action that wins the game will have a reward of 1, and an action that results in the game continuing will have a reward of 0.
